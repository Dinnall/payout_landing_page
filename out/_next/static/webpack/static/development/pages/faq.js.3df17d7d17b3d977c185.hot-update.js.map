It must be completed no later than 45 calendar days after your child’s referral to EI.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"accordion-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Usually what's next after EI?</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"accordion-icon\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"accordion-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EI services are available at least until your child turns three years old. At that time, your\nchild may no longer need services or may transition to other services. At least six\nmonths before your child turns three, your child’s service coordinator should help you\nbegin the transition process. </p>\n<p>Many children who have had EI services are eligible for preschool special education\nservices. The Committee on Preschool Special Education (CPSE) provides these services\nfor children ages three to five. The CPSE is part of the Committee on Special Education\n(CSE) in the NYC Department of Education, not the NYC Department of Health and\nMental Hygiene. The CPSE provides evaluations and services at no cost to families.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t                        </ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>    </div>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default About;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA7DA;AACA;AA2EA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
