When a group of people create a sou-sou, they each contribute an equal amount of money into a fund. They may pay into the pool weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, but each month the total fund is paid out to one member of the group. The pool rotates until all members have received their share.</p>\n                                   <p>For example, if ten members create a sou-sou together and each member contributes $100 a month, than each month one member will be paid out the sum of $1000. Every ten months, the rotation begins again.</p>\n\t                                </div>\n\t                            </li>\n\t                        </ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>    </div>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default About;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAlBA;AACA;AA4BA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
